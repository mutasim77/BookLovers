                        <h2>Books to Look Out For Out for in January 2023</h2>
                        <p>
                            The second instalment of January fiction is all about and written by women beginning with a
                            novel set in a world which tends to be dominated by men. Based on interviews with a female
                            horse trainer, Kathryn Scanlan’s Kick the Latch follows one woman’s career while exploring
                            all aspects of life at the racetrack, from the track winners to the grooms, jockeys and
                            racing secretaries...

                        <h2>Books of the Year 2022</h2>
                        <p>
                            This year continued the move back towards normality for me. H and I finally managed to take
                            both the holidays abroad we’d booked for 2020 and there was much more socialising and
                            getting out and about. We’re going to the cinema again (easy to lose touch when you don’t
                            see the trailers) but I’ve realised Cover image for Zorrie by Laird Huntthat the world music
                            gigs we enjoyed so much have been scuppered by Brexit. Yet another unwelcome side effect. As
                            for books, as ever, I’ve struggled to get this year’s favourites down to twenty so it will
                            be four posts again, beginning with a long one for the first quarter of the year when we
                            were still hiding from Omicron...

                        <h2>Six Degrees of Separation – The Snow Child to Weasels in the Attic</h2>
                        <p>
                            Six Degrees of Separation is a meme hosted by Kate over at Books Are My Favourite and Best.
                            It works like this: each month a book is chosen as a starting point and linked to six others
                            to form a chain. A book doesn’t need to be connected to all the titles on the list, only to
                            the one next to it in the chain.
                            This month we’re starting with Eowyn Ivey’s The Snow Child which I’ve not read but I gather
                            it’s based on a Russian fairy tale about a childless couple who one day find a little girl
                            on their land.
                            There’s more than a whiff of the fairy tale about Helen Oyeyemi’s Boy Snow Bird, a tale of
                            race and identity...

                        <h2>Five Swedish Novels I’ve Read</h2>
                        <p>
                            Given how much of my viewing time has been spent there thanks to Walter Presents, you’d
                            think I’d have read more Scandinavian fiction but perhaps it’s because so much of the
                            translated variety is crime related. Below are five striking Swedish novels I’ve read, all
                            with links to my reviews, beginning with an award-winning piece of crime Cover image for To

                        <h2>Dinosaurs: A Novel by Lydia Millet: "You can do your best all your life"</h2>
                        <p>
                            I spotted Lydia Millet’s Dinosaurs on NetGalley, pleased to be reminded of how much I’d
                            enjoyed Oh Pure and Radiant Heart many moons ago. This subtle, understated novel follows Gil
                            who’s decided to put his New York past behind him and move to Arizona, captivated by footage
                            of the Arizonan landscape, and having nothing better to do, decides to walk there.
                            Lane’s memory took up the space where new affection might live. Lost and aimless, like a
                            faithful dog.
