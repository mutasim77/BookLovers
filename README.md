Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹ <br>
Welcome to the BookLoversðŸ“š site. This site was build as my final project for Front-end courseðŸ’». <br> 
This project was really fun and interesting to develop. Because of all the features I included in my website. <br>
To be honest this was a group project, but i did it solo cause I prefer do work alone for this types of projects.
